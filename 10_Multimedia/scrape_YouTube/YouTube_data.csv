Take a look at the fastest and the largest birds in the world… You have a great opportunity to see these magnificent birds in their natural habitat, in Kalahari Desert, South Africa.

Be amazed at their cute chicks. They are vulnerable and pathetic little creatures following their great parents everywhere.
